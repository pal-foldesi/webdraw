# Webdraw

I was inspired by [a chapter on fractals](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-8-fractals/) in Daniel Shiffman's book [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book), and wanted to venture into L-Systems and turtle graphics using the Canvas API, while allowing the user to customize their art.

This is the result.
